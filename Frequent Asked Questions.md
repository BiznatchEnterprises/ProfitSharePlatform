Can Profit Shares Platform be compared to a bond market for Crypto projects?
(if it is more like shares, what is the difference between the assets on profit
shares platform and a new token?)

In some ways, yes a Bond and Profit Share have similarities. The Profit Share will be
represented using a Dynamic Token asset. They can be considered smart-contracts
with unlimited potential in terms of technical functionality and financial liquidity. Each
Profit Share token will fully represent an existing digital or physical asset such as
Bitcoin, BTA, bullion or even fiat currency. Essentially - they're an external method for
representing something of value using crypto-signatures. In the use of a Profit Share,
they become a digital loan contract with static or dynamic capabilities for return rates,
terms of repayment and even controlling liquid venture capital by multiple entities.
