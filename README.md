Profit Shares Platform is a closed-source (soon to be open-source) conceptual network used to self-regulate "cryptomarkets",
They can be considered a "controlled" alternative to exchange tokens. These will never become volatile digital assets and remain secured using cryptography. They remain 100% backed at all times by a secondary blockchain asset such as BTC, BTA, ETH and STRAT. Crowdfunding BATA projects using non-expiring, liquid capital profit shares. Profit Shares can offer liquid, stable and consistent returns for investors.

The shares are mathematically controlled to prevent crashing. Price per share = fund balance / total shares
The community decides on their price movements and thus controls their volatility by allowing the fund administrators (or in the future - smart contracts) to remove funds for development use or require new business profits to be distributed with share holders. This unique and transparent system is still in experimental and development stages. We fully welcome all questions or new ideas.

Profit Shares will also work through a node system, but these nodes will not require any coins to be operated. A web-server running PHP, and general web-development experience. Secondary nodes will be compatible with Desktop, Tablet, Mobile and other devices. No coins will be required to run these services – if you’re running a primary node then you have the ability to charge user-fees on your own terms. We’re going the let the free-market decide ROI on running network nodes for Profit Shares, There will be no direct network fees implemented during the initial launch but this feature may be introduced in the future depending on community developments.

This will allow users to purchase & create bond like financial instruments using blockchain technologies. Variable, programmable investment terms and flexible rates of return can be created using a new technology for smart-contracts. Profit Shares can generate a yield to the holder of these instruments and provide a transparent, affordable, easy to use platform for investment funds, businesses and even governments. One can think of the Profit Shares Platform like an ultra advanced version of kickstarter while integrating peer to peer exchanges for digital financial assets.

Multiple forms of payment can be integrated within the platform. Automated transaction processing within a timely manner, allows the network to function in real-time ecommerce industries.
